# Active state

## Status

The repository is preparing a full architectural replacement. Existing source code and wire schemas are legacy until the roadmap is executed. No feature spec for the replacement has been created yet.

Normative documentation:

- [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md)
- [`docs/architecture/`](../docs/architecture/README.md)
- [`architecture-knowledge-engine-roadmap.md`](../architecture-knowledge-engine-roadmap.md)

## Decisions

### AD-001 — Standardized generator-owned taxonomy

- **Decision**: csharp2md owns a machine-readable, versioned taxonomy. Structural facts, immutable observations, classified facts, confirmed relations and derived projections are separate contracts.
- **Reason**: the legacy flat relation model mixed structure, behavior, protocol and confidence, producing broad and ambiguous links.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-002 — No compatibility constraint during replacement

- **Decision**: the replacement may break CLI, output, schemas, IDs and layout. Continuity begins only at the first completed post-migration release.
- **Reason**: the product is not in use and will only be consumed after migration; compatibility work would preserve contracts scheduled for deletion.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-003 — Roslyn and trust boundary

- **Decision**: target `net10.0` and `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild` 5.6.0; do not reference `Microsoft.Build.*` or call `MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults()`. Semantic analysis requires trusted input, source generators require separate opt-in, and diagnostic analyzers never run.
- **Reason**: Roslyn 4.9+ uses the out-of-process BuildHost, while MSBuild evaluation and generators can execute repository-controlled code.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-004 — Evidence before promotion

- **Decision**: extractors publish immutable observations. Versioned classifiers are the only modules that promote observations into architectural/persistence facts or confirmed causal relations, always with `derived_from` and rejected-candidate traceability.
- **Reason**: classification at extraction time made broad heuristics indistinguishable from direct evidence.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-005 — Business interpretation is downstream

- **Decision**: the generator does not produce business-rule or decision facts. It publishes complete relevant code, flows' direct technical ingredients, contracts, configuration and persistence evidence for a downstream LLM.
- **Reason**: conditions such as `balance < amount` require contextual interpretation rather than a universal static taxonomy.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-006 — Deep modules and storage seam

- **Decision**: the target assemblies are `Csharp2Md.Domain`, `Csharp2Md.Analysis`, `Csharp2Md.Storage`, `Csharp2Md.Projection` and `Csharp2Md.Cli`. Analysis exposes one high-level interface and writes through a transactional storage port; CLI contains no taxonomy or classification logic.
- **Reason**: the legacy core mixed orchestration, Roslyn, persistence, validation and presentation.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-007 — Directly navigable factual package

- **Decision**: the generator publishes a manifest-led package of facts, observations, confirmed relations, candidates, diagnostics, compact postings, Markdown and source locators. Markdown is projection, never authority.
- **Reason**: an LLM must be able to navigate generated files directly without a database or mandatory query engine.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-008 — One to many solutions, isolated semantics

- **Decision**: one invocation accepts `1..N` explicit solutions. Each solution is analyzed and committed independently; global composition contains only catalog identities and proven external relations.
- **Reason**: merging solutions into one Roslyn universe creates ambiguous compilation contexts and unbounded memory.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-009 — Coverage and certification

- **Decision**: run coverage and labeled-corpus classifier quality are independent. Mandatory areas are entry points, linked calls, contracts and persistence; precision/recall claims require ground truth.
- **Reason**: a production run cannot truthfully report recall for an unknown universe.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-010 — Proof states, not numeric confidence

- **Decision**: publish `evidence_method`, `resolution` and `frontier` as independent axes. Candidates stay outside the confirmed graph; there is no required numeric confidence score.
- **Reason**: a numeric score would imply calibration not supported by deterministic evidence.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-011 — Query and wiki layers are deferred

- **Decision**: query engines, `kb`, QMD, embeddings, wiki compilation and LLM context packaging are outside the generator replacement. A query layer may later consume the completed package without redefining taxonomy.
- **Reason**: the initial product must first produce complete, precise and directly navigable evidence.
- **Status**: active.

### AD-012 — Documentation and implementation migration

- **Decision**: the roadmap is split into bounded specs. Legacy specs, tickets and superseded decision prose are removed from the working tree; Git is their history. The first new spec is not created as part of documentation replacement.
- **Reason**: retaining executable-looking legacy plans confuses agents and spends context on contracts that will be deleted.
- **Status**: active.

## Standing engineering constraints

- Retrieval-led reasoning is mandatory for .NET/Roslyn work; never invent a Roslyn API.
- Source and factual content must be deterministic independently of absolute clone path and input order.
- Structural corruption aborts atomic publication; legitimate unknowns and candidates do not.
- Secrets are never duplicated into facts, observations, indexes or diagnostics.
- The tlc-spec-driven discrimination sensor remains skipped; the user runs Stryker manually. All other verifier steps remain required when feature execution begins.
